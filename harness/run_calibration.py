"""Phase 1 calibration run.

Scores the corpus with Jev, computes the metrics, writes results.json and
a reliability diagram. Every response is cached, so a second run costs
nothing and the notebook is reproducible without re-spending.

Usage:
    export TYPESAFE_AI_API_KEY=...
    python3 run_calibration.py --pilot          # 10 rows, prints cost estimate
    python3 run_calibration.py                  # full run
    python3 run_calibration.py --analyze-only   # recompute from cache

Design note on batching: each row sends one request carrying every
question for that row (noul, the negated noul, choice and score). Jev
answers independent questions against one state in a single parallel
pass, so this is one request where the naive shape would be four, and the
state tokens are paid for once instead of four times.
