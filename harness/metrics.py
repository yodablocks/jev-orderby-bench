"""Calibration and ranking metrics for the Phase 1 gate.

Two families, because the build spec's gate as written measures the wrong
thing for half the product.

Calibration (Brier, ECE) answers "is 0.7 really 70%". It is the right
question for `jev_bool`, where the probability is surfaced to the caller
and thresholded.

Ranking (Spearman, pairwise inversion) answers "does sorting by this put
rows in the right order". That is what semantic ORDER BY actually does.
The two come apart in both directions:

  - A model whose probabilities are all squashed into [0.4, 0.6] but
    perfectly ordered has terrible ECE and sorts perfectly.
  - A model that is well calibrated in aggregate can still invert many
    individual pairs, and sorts badly.

So a gate on ECE alone can kill a model that sorts fine, or pass one that
sorts badly. Report both, gate on both.

Brier and ECE are classification metrics and do not apply to a continuous
Score. For Score we report rank metrics against the human labels, plus
the scale, because Score returns a probability-weighted mean over level
*indices*: range 0..len(rubric)-1, not 0..1.

    """Phase 1 stop/go.

    Thresholds are our own, set before seeing results so they cannot be
    rationalised afterwards. They are deliberately not the vendor's: the
    vendor's 67.8% agreement figure is self-run and unreproduced, and
    agreement with averaged frontier judgments is not calibration.

    The spec asks for the three primitives to be reported separately
    because they may calibrate differently. They must therefore be *gated*
    separately too. Gating only jev_bool would let a Score that inverts a
    third of its pairs through, and `jev_score_val` is the accessor ORDER
    BY actually sorts on: it is the single most product-critical number
    here, so it gets its own condition rather than riding on the Boolean.

      ece <= 0.10        A stated 0.8 that is really 0.7 is tolerable for
                         ranking; wider and the probability is decorative.
      inversion <= 0.15  Above roughly one bad pair in six, a sorted page
                         of results looks visibly wrong to a user. Applied
                         to Boolean and Score independently.
      resolution > 0     Anything at or below zero means the model is not
                         separating the classes at all.
